# Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my implementations of algorithms from books, lectures, open source coding challenges and algorithm found in articles.

The organization of this repository is such that each mentioned source has its own folder inside the root folder.
Each of these subfolders contains an independent Eclipse project with its own codebase (src/) for the code it contains.

I did that so I don't have to spawn dozens of github repositories who in essence deal with the same thing: implementing algorithms in Java.

## Sources

### MIT-6006 Introduction to Algorithms:

An introductory course on data structures and algorithms.
I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to brush up core algorithm skills.
All lecture material (videos, problem sets, handouts) is available online for free.

- [MIT 6006 - Introduction to Algorithms Fall 2011 on OpenCourseWare (OCW)](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/ "MIT 6006 - Introduction to Algorithms on OpenCourseWare (OCW)")

### Coding and Foo:

I sometimes implement an interesting algorithm and explain it on my blog.

### Programming Interviews Exposed:

This is a book which you can get in different flavors (i.e. Java Programming Interviews Exposed).

### Cracking The Coding Interview:

This is another (excellent) book with many tips and challenges for preparing for coding interviews.
